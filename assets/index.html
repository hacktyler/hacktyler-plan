                <h1>The Urban Plan for Tyler</h1>

                <p>A short-term plan to connect and develop the urban regions of Tyler into a place suitable for residents who desire an urban lifestyle.</p>

                <p>Unless otherwise specified all suggestions below refer to downtown Tyler and the surrounding neighborhoods including north Tyler south of Gentry, Brick Streets Historical District and Charnwood Historical District. This area is roughly bounded by Gentry Parkway in the north, 4th Street in the south, Palace Avenue (becoming Vine Avenue) in the west and Beckham Avenue in the east. This boundary outlines to the area of Tyler with significant existing pedestrian infrastructure.</p>

                <p><em>Read about the origins of this plan at <a href="http://hacktyler.com/TODO">Hack Tyler</a>.</em></p>

                <h2>Transportation</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Connect and repair existing sidewalks.</li>
                    <li>Establish a pedestrian corridor along Broadway so that residents can safely commute on foot.</li>
                    <li>Extend the Donnybrook bike lane north from 5th street to Houston Street and then up Fannin Avenue.</li>
                    <li>Install bike racks around the square.</li>
                    <li>Repair, restore and extend the original brick streets in places where they have been paved over.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Transportation is Perhaps the most fundamental component of urbanism. In larger cities residents might use mass transit, but Tyler can't support it and the existing bus system has not reached critical mass. Instead, the options for traversing the city without using car are limited to walking and cycling--and both of these are fraught. In order to maximize the available infrastructure the target area of these suggestions is confined to the area of Tyler with existing sidewalk. Sadly, in many places these sidewalks are incomplete or falling apart. Connecting and repairing the sidewalks will make capitalize on the fact that many Tylerites have already chosen to live near downtown and in walkable neighborhoods.</p>

                <p>To expand the influence of the neighborhoods surrounding downtown will require creating new urban commuter corridors. If residents are to support downtown business they need to be able to safely walk or cycle downtown, both of which are uncomfortable undertakings due to heavy traffic, poorly timed signals, broken sidewalks and a lack of shade trees along arterial streets. By expanding this network the number of citizens in a position to support and enjoy a revitalized downtown will increase dramatically.</p>

                <h2>Planning</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Require all new and renovated multi-tenant residential developments to be mixed-income.</li>
                    <li>Incentivize development of new homes on vacant residential lots.</li>
                    <li>Incentivize redevelopment of vacant commercial low-rises in the downtown area as residential units.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Redevelopment of Tyler's downtown must incorporate smart planning if it is to create a vibrant community while at the same time minimizing the effects of gentrification. Tyler should require that residential properties in downtown are mixed-income by design. This will prevent the minority communities to the north and west from being disenfranchised as downtown becomes a more desirable living space. Downtown is literally the point where Tyler's very segregated racial and economic communities meet on the map. Everything possible should be done to ensure all groups are stakeholders in its reconstruction.</p>

                <p>More must also be done to clean up blighted properties in the region. Downtown has several large buildings that are either vacant or underused. Providing incentives for these properties to be redeveloped should happen in tandem with other developments. A similar strategy can be pursued in the neighborhoods around downtown where a single vacant lot frequently effects the desirability of an entire block. See for example [ TODO TODO ].</p>


                <h2>Business</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Bring a grocery store or green market to downtown.</li>
                    <li>Bring a beer garden or pub-style restaurant to downtown.</li>
                    <li>Bring a hotel to downtown.</li>
                    <li>Expand the Downtown Tyler Facade Grant Program to encourage restaurants to establish outdoor and storefront dining opportunities.</li>
                    <li>Incentivize minority owned businesses in downtown.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Much of Tyler's governance is executed in the form of public-private partnerships and downtown revitalization should continue that strategy. To that end, the city should do everything possible to lure businesses downtown which will A) encourage residents to spend their time and money in the city center and B) provide anchors to attract regional visitors and tourists. The Discovery Science Center and Liberty Theater are good, existing examples of the latter, but without expanded living and dining opportunities their influence will be severely constrained.</p>

                <p>These businesses need a reliable consumer base, which is why the transportation improvements outlined above are crucial to the success of downtown revitalization. Residents in the surrounding neighborhoods can provide crucial support for new businesses while downtown living spaces are under development. In the area outlined in this report, no residents are more than 1.4 miles from downtown, a reasonable walking distance for anyone in adequate health.</p>

                <h2>Community</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Clear the foundations of the old car lots west of downtown and convert this area to green space.</li>
                    <li>Extend evening and weekend hours at the city library.</li>
                    <li>Recruit a librarian with documented experience bringing teenagers and young adults into the library.</li>
                    <li>Explore opportunities for events and programs that will bring TJC and UT students downtown.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A urban space is only successful as its capacity to bring people together. To that end the city should look to convert the vacant space immediately west of downtown into a public park. Other small park-style enclaves could also be pursued in the style of the sculpture garden on Spring Ave. Having green spaces in the heart of the city will provide a natural gathering place for all citizens of Tyler and a necessary counterpoint to the acres of concrete.</p>

                <p>Other public programs, such as those at the library should be expanded to appeal to a younger demographic and to leverage other improvements downtown. The 15 to 24 demographic represents over 18% of Tyler's population, yet there are virtually no reasons for them to spend any time in the downtown area. If they had reasons to be downtown they would natural a audience for all the improvements in this plan to support.</p>
